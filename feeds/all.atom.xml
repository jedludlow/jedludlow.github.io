thought it might be &lt;em&gt;really useful&lt;/em&gt; for someone
in New York to talk to someone in San Fransisco &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_transcontinental_telephone_call"&gt;&lt;em&gt;by telephone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
They eventually succeeded in completing the first
voice test of the system in 1914, and the first "official" 
transcontinental long distance phone call occurred in January
of 1915. 
As is often the case, the first implementation of the system
was really a prototype that would only handle limited load.
The ultimate vision was a system that could handle thousands
of voice calls simultaneously. There were large technical hurdles
to clear to make that a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the primary hurdles was amplification. If you want to 
string a very long wire and put lots of phone calls down that same 
wire, you have to place repeater amplifiers 
at points along the line that can boost the 
signal up without distorting it or adding noise to it.
The amplifier technology of 1920 was not up to the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1921 a young electrical engineer named Harold Black joined the 
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Electric"&gt;Western Electric Company&lt;/a&gt;, an arm of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_System"&gt;Bell System&lt;/a&gt;, eventually
to become part of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs"&gt;Bell Labs&lt;/a&gt; when it was formed in 1925. 
Within several months of joining, 
Harold had succeeded in arranging an assignment to work
on stabilizing and linearizing amplifiers to support the
development of a large-scale long distance phone system. It would
be several years before his work bore fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Alt text" src="https://www.jedludlow.com/images/Harold_Stephen_Black.gif" title="Harold Stephen Black"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Harold Black. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Harold_Stephen_Black.gif"&gt;(Source)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've studied dynamic systems or control engineering
the names of Nyquist and Bode, also &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs"&gt;Bell Labs&lt;/a&gt; scientists in the
early 20th century,
are most certainly familiar. But Harold Black? You've probably never heard
of him. Yet his invention revolutionized the telecommunications industry and
had far-reaching consequences in other branches of engineering. 
Its impact can hardly be overstated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Harold invented is called the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_feedback_amplifier"&gt;&lt;em&gt;negative feedback amplifier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
This classic video footage on the subject from the AT&amp;amp;T archives is worth watching:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="youtube" align="left"&gt;
&lt;iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/iFrxyJAtJ7U" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside: The hand sketches on newsprint shown in the video actually came five days
later and relate to impedance matching the amplifier to the load.
According to an &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MSPEC.1977.6501721"&gt;article published in IEEE Spectrum&lt;/a&gt;, the
sketches from the initial invention, also sketched on newsprint, were actually a simple block diagram and a couple of equations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.jedludlow.com/images/negative_feedback.png" width="315" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Negative feedback block diagram and equations. &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MSPEC.1977.6501721"&gt;(Source)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me personally, the invention itself is only part of the significance of this story. I'm
forever grateful for Harold's candor in describing his years
of unsuccessful design attempts and the flash of inspiration that ultimately
accompanied the final breakthrough.
This is &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MSPEC.1977.6501721"&gt;his own written description&lt;/a&gt; of the event:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came the morning of Tuesday, August 2, 1927,
when the concept of the negative feedback amplifier came
to me in a flash while I was crossing the Hudson River on
the Lackawanna Ferry, on my way to work. For more than
50 years I have pondered how and why the idea came, and
I can't say any more today than I could that morning. All
I know is that after several years of hard work on the
problem, I suddenly realized that if I fed the amplifier
output back to the input, in reverse phase, and kept the
device from oscillating (singing, as we called it then), I
would have exactly what I wanted: a means of canceling
out the distortion in the output. I opened my morning
newspaper and on a page of &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; I
sketched a simple canonical diagram of a negative feedback
amplifier plus the equations for the amplification
with feedback. I signed the sketch, and 20 minutes
later, when I reached the laboratory at 463 West Street,
it was witnessed, understood, and signed by the late Earl
C. Blessing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, here is my
personal recipe for changing the world while remaining
in relative obscurity, modeled on the work of Harold Black:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pursue opportunities that have the potential of
making a serious difference in the world. Work on hard problems. When solutions
don't immediately present themselves, keep going. Wait
patiently for pure inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;R on Windows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes, rmagic assumes that a working version of &lt;a href="http://www.r-project.org/"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;
is available on the Windows &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt;. The most recent Windows
installers for R 3.0 do not modify the &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt;
variable. This is actually a good thing because it allows you to install
multiple versions of R in whatever 32-bit or 64-bit flavors you'd like,
and they can all co-exist peacefully. That said, to get rmagic 
to work you'll have to put one of
them on the &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt; by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Which Flavor?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flavor of R you put on the &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt; must
match the flavor of Python you are targeting. More specifically, if
you're running 32-bit Python, place a 32-bit flavor of R on the path.
The locations of these binaries will probably look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;32-bit R: &lt;code&gt;C:\Program Files\R\R-3.0.3\bin\i386&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;64-bit R: &lt;code&gt;C:\Program Files\R\R-3.0.3\bin\x64&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's &lt;em&gt;critical&lt;/em&gt; to go all the way down to these flavor-specific
directories since it's really &lt;code&gt;R.dll&lt;/code&gt; that
needs be available to rmagic. Why
is that? Read on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;rpy2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to a working R install, rmagic in
IPython 2.0 uses &lt;a href="http://rpy.sourceforge.net/rpy2.html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;rpy2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as
the connection between Python and R. Installing &lt;code&gt;rpy2&lt;/code&gt; on
Windows is not quite as simple as it perhaps should be, and &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=rpy2+windows"&gt;Stack
Overflow is littered&lt;/a&gt; with questions about failed attempts at using &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt;
or &lt;code&gt;easy_install&lt;/code&gt;.
After culling through several of those posts, I happened upon one that
actually had the &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5068760/bizzarre-issue-trying-to-make-rpy2-2-1-9-work-with-r-2-12-1-using-python-2-6-un"&gt;right magic beans&lt;/a&gt;. The post is a little dated, so
here's a refreshed summary of the simplest path to success today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As described above, pick a suitable flavor of R, and put it on the
    &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pull down the (unofficial) &lt;a href="http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#rpy2"&gt;&lt;code&gt;rpy2&lt;/code&gt; binaries&lt;/a&gt; from
    &lt;a href="http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/"&gt;Christhoph Gohlke's treasure trove&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure you pick the right Python version of the
    binaries to match your Python flavor, including Python version
    number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install those binaries into whatever Python environment you intend
    to use. (Did you know you can &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3271590/can-i-install-python-windows-packages-into-virtualenvs"&gt;install binary packages into any Python environment&lt;/a&gt;, even those not in the Windows registry? That
    includes an &lt;a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/"&gt;Anaconda&lt;/a&gt; install.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an environment variable called &lt;code&gt;R_HOME&lt;/code&gt;,
    and point it to the base R install directory. If your paths look
    like those above, that would be &lt;code&gt;"C:\Program
    Files\R\R-3.0.3"&lt;/code&gt; or
    whatever matches your R version.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an environment variable
    called &lt;code&gt;R_USER&lt;/code&gt;, and set it to your Windows username.
    This looks to be in line with &lt;a href="https://bitbucket.org/lgautier/rpy2/issue/95/automagic-settings-for-windows"&gt;recent discussion&lt;/a&gt; on the R
    development issues list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you've done all that, open up a fresh command prompt and verify
that all your environment changes were correctly set. Then fire up
IPython notebook, issue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;%load_ext&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rmagic&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;in a cell, and the rest of the
&lt;a href="http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/config/extensions/rmagic.html"&gt;guidance in the IPython documentation&lt;/a&gt;
should then apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some Issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it's not necessarily
all roses after that. There are still issues with getting some
information back and forth across the R-Python interface in pristine
format. Sometimes the output from R commands doesn't completely make it
into the notebook and ends up being printed in the command shell window
from which the notebook is running. But aside from a few minor
inconveniences, it doesn't look like there are any real errors
happening.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="tech"></category><category term="python"></category><category term="r"></category></entry><entry><title>Irrigation System Performance Measurement on the Cheap</title><link href="https://www.jedludlow.com/2014/04/irrigation-system-performance.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-04-26T11:33:00-06:00</published><updated>2014-04-26T11:33:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Jed Ludlow</name></author><id>tag:www.jedludlow.com,2014-04-26:/2014/04/irrigation-system-performance.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;What began as a simple exercise in turning on the irrigation water to

the yard culminated in an hour of &lt;a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/03/dont_shave_that.html"&gt;yak shaving&lt;/a&gt; in which I actually
measured the performance of my sprinklers. The well-meaning people at my
City Hall had sent out an informative flyer earlier in the week with
tips about conserving water during the upcoming summer, not recognizing
the Siren song they would ultimately create for me by suggesting that
one could &lt;em&gt;measure&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;optimize&lt;/em&gt; a sprinkler system. While my
engineering disease puts me at risk for over optimization to start with,
I'm particularly susceptible to the temptation posed by measurement
science problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flyer included a link to a web address with detailed
instructions for &lt;a href="http://wateringschedule.com/"&gt;computing station timing&lt;/a&gt; for a yard irrigation
system, sponsored by &lt;a href="http://www.orbitonline.com/"&gt;Orbit Irrigation&lt;/a&gt;. I wasn't about to pay for
&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CBZB8U8"&gt;the catch cup kit&lt;/a&gt; they were offering, but fortunately they gave away
the key specification for supplanting the commercial catch cups with
something ad hoc. Off I went looking for something with a 16.25 square
inch catch opening. An opening diameter of about 4.6 inch does the
trick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With some luck, it didn't take me long to find a reasonable
solution. Who knew that the cottage cheese industry was secretly out to
ruin the catch cup business for the irrigation industry? I no longer
question why my wife has saved so many of these in a drawer in the
kitchen. I now understand that they are a valuable instrument to an
irrigation system measurement technician, and she &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; have realized
that long before I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.jedludlow.com/images/cottage_cheese_cup.jpg" width="315" /&gt;
&lt;img src="https://www.jedludlow.com/images/measure_cup_opening.jpg" width="300" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With catch cups in hand, I headed to the yard to make
measurements. My yard has conventional pop up spray heads in the front
and a bit fancier gear driven rotor heads in the back. When I installed
the rotors a couple of years ago the hardware store people told me I'd
have to run them a lot longer than the old pop ups, but their even spray
pattern would provide better overall performance. Quite honestly, the
back lawn didn't fare very well over the last summer compared to the
front, so a primary goal of my measurements was to get a feel for just
how much longer the recommended station timing would be for the back
yard rotors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.jedludlow.com/images/cups_on_grass.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After laying out catch cups and throwing on the stations for
several minutes I was ready to measure the volume of water in each cup.
I debated using a tablespoon and converting the measurements to mL
later, but then I remembered that there is another stash of special
little plastic cups in our house has that has mL graduations built right
in. Thank you, children's cold medicine people, for providing miniature
graduated cylinders in every box!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to scale back the effort and only measure one station in the
front and one in the back. I found the simple instructions for mapping
and recording the measurements as suggested by the website to be quite
helpful.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.jedludlow.com/images/raw_sprinkler_notes.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With final measurements in hand it was a simple matter to run the
calculator on the website. I won't post the final recommended run times
since they would be specific to my system, climate, and soil type. But I
will say that, much to my surprise, the gear rotors need to run &lt;em&gt;four
times&lt;/em&gt; as long as the pop ups to deliver an equivalent volume of water
to the yard. That's a lot longer than I was running them last summer
when the back grass was looking so bad. And it only took me one
inexpensive yak shave to figure that out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="data science"></category></entry><entry><title>My 15 Seconds of Car Talk Fame</title><link href="https://www.jedludlow.com/2013/03/my-15-seconds-of-car-talk-fame.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-03-03T21:54:00-07:00</published><updated>2013-03-03T21:54:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Jed Ludlow</name></author><id>tag:www.jedludlow.com,2013-03-03:/2013/03/my-15-seconds-of-car-talk-fame.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was a dark day around our house several months ago when it was

announced that no new &lt;a href="http://www.cartalk.com/"&gt;Car Talk&lt;/a&gt; episodes would be recorded. The show
has been part of my week for nearly 20 years. Like all great shows that
are eventually put out to pasture, we can still enjoy reruns. Much to my
surprise, &lt;a href="http://www.cartalk.com/content/1309-pit-despair"&gt;this week's "best-of" show&lt;/a&gt; contained &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_IxcYvuiw0WVTlxWGZmZFo4cUE/edit?usp=sharing"&gt;my 15 seconds of Car
Talk fame&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after starting graduate school, I was dutifully toiling away
on homework one Saturday morning with Car Talk playing in the
background. This was long before the podcast era, so if you didn't hear
it when it was originally broadcast you pretty much missed it for that
week. At any rate, a &lt;a href="http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/CubScouts.aspx"&gt;Cub Scout&lt;/a&gt; Den Mother called in with some
questions about how to advise her Cubs on the issue of weight placement
in their Pinewood Derby cars. I wasn't completely satisfied with Tom and
Ray's answer, so I wrote up a quick technical note called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_IxcYvuiw0WTjdBbEJxV291UXM/edit?usp=sharing"&gt;On the
Placement of Weight in a Pinewood Derby Car&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and mailed it in, never
expecting to hear more of it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some weeks later I got a phone call from a relative, asking me if I had
ever sent anything in to the Car Talk guys. I confirmed that I had but
was puzzled as to why he would know about it. It turns out that my
write-up had been mentioned during a "Stump the Chumps" segment of the
show that week, and he called to tell me about it. I had missed the
broadcast entirely. This week's rebroadcast was actually the first time
I heard it for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float:right" src="https://www.jedludlow.com/images/A_Fast_Car.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have my first Pinewood Derby car, the one that took first place
in my local race. It stays safely packed away in a box and only comes
out for special occasions. You can guess its age by the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontiac_Firebird"&gt;Firebird&lt;/a&gt;
logo on the front. Thanks to a great father and to other great Scout
leaders those were special days never to be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many years later now, it takes more than one hand's worth of fingers to
count the number of derbies I've participated in with my own sons. I can
say with fairly high confidence that, backed by empirical evidence,
weight placement is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the most important factor in the speed of a
car. Sure, you should still bring the car up to the maximum allowable
weight and place that weight near the rear axle to be a competitor. But
invariably the fastest cars have ultra low rolling resistance, and they
&lt;em&gt;track perfectly straight&lt;/em&gt;. No amount of weight fiddling can compensate
for a car that incurs huge amounts of drag by continually rubbing up
against the central track guide.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="car talk"></category></entry><entry><title>A Quick FFT Example in Python</title><link href="https://www.jedludlow.com/2012/11/a-quick-fft-example-in-python.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-11-19T04:42:00-07:00</published><updated>2012-11-19T04:42:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Jed Ludlow</name></author><id>tag:www.jedludlow.com,2012-11-19:/2012/11/a-quick-fft-example-in-python.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here's a quick &lt;a href="http://ipython.org/"&gt;IPython&lt;/a&gt; notebook &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/3919130"&gt;gist&lt;/a&gt; about FFTs in Python.

basketball star for the Lakers. I've re-posted just a few paragraphs.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Los Angeles Lakers star A.C. Green became known as the NBA's
"Iron Man" for playing in a record 1,192 straight games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out he almost didn't play pro basketball at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While visiting a former teacher in Hermiston, Ore., with 10 of his
closest friends, the group decided to attend a nearby Christian
church. After the service, the pastor and Green discussed his
spiritual future and the prospect of being found in the Kingdom of
God. The 17-year-old high school all-American, who had just received a
full-ride scholarship to the number one basketball school in the
country — Oregon State — had only one question: "Does this mean I
don't play basketball anymore?"  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although he was willing to give up the game altogether, the pastor
told him that wouldn't be necessary, as long as he honored the Lord
through his game. However, Green's response showed the beginning of
his "all chips in" approach to the Christian lifestyle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There was no turning back for me," Green says. "Matthew 6:33: 'Seek
ye first the kingdom of God and all things shall be added unto you'
was just something I was dumb enough to believe was true. I told the
Lord 'You redefine what it is that I am now as a man. You tell me who
A.C. Green is. What people say and what you say are two different
things and I need to know what it is that you say.'"&lt;/p&gt;

could have done at the time. It completely cured my fear of electronics,
and it set the stage for a future filled with problems that didn't fit
into a single engineering discipline.  &lt;/p&gt;

grasp his articles on &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bob+pease+fuzzy+logic"&gt;fuzzy logic&lt;/a&gt; as a student, mostly because I had
studied enough control systems to make the discussion relevant. At the

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The words or the language, as they are written or spoken, do not seem
to play any role in my mechanism of thought. The psychical entities
which seem to serve as elements in thought are certain signs and more
or less clear images which can be 'voluntarily' reproduced and

in productive thought before there is any connection with logical
construction in words or other kinds of signs which can be
communicated to others.&lt;/em&gt; (Albert Einstein in a letter to Jacques
Hadamard)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://micrium.com/about/management/"&gt;Jean Labrosse&lt;/a&gt;, the well-respected author of the &lt;a href="http://micrium.com/page/products/rtos/os-ii"&gt;µC/OS-II RTOS&lt;/a&gt;,
recently published an article in Embedded Systems Design entitled
&lt;a href="http://www.embedded.com/design/prototyping-and-development/4215492/Adopting-C-programming-conventions"&gt;Adopting C programming conventions&lt;/a&gt;. If you've read the article, you
can easily understand the stir it might create. Some of the ideas he
advocates are not generally accepted as "good practice" among most
embedded developers. It is no surprise that the comment section that
follows the article is full of gripes and is largely devoid of praise.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the source code for µC/OS-II is cited by many as a prime
example of beautiful, clean embedded C code, worthy of study. The RTOS
itself is considered to be highly reliable. True to form, the coding
style throughout conforms to Mr. Labrosse's conventions. Quite a
paradox.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first response was to conclude that maybe Mr. Labrosse is just
smarter than all the rest of us, and it wouldn't matter if his coding
style were in complete opposition to what most consider "good practice."
He'd figure out how to bring order to the system and ship something
exceptional. That may, in fact, be true. But then I remembered the above
from Einstein, and it completely changed my line of thought toward
something more productive.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source code is such a crude description of the intricate mental models
that reside in our heads when crafting software systems. The process of
first distilling a mental model to code is so much smoother than the
process of recreating a mental model from reading source code.
Unfortunately, most of us lead lives that prevent us from maintaining
that system model in our heads indefinitely. We're constantly required
to rebuild the model after being away from the problem for a while. As I
look closer at Mr. Labrosse's conventions, I see a set of rules that
allow him to create a richer &lt;em&gt;reading&lt;/em&gt; experience for himself, each
construct seeded with clues about how it fits into the larger system,
assisting him to reconstruct the "clear images" in his mind each time he
returns to the code. That sounds like "good practice" to me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="tech"></category><category term="c/c++"></category><category term="embedded"></category></entry><entry><title>Wrapping C++ in a C Interface</title><link href="https://www.jedludlow.com/2011/01/this-is-perhaps-simplest-slickest-way.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-01-22T14:49:00-07:00</published><updated>2011-01-22T14:49:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Jed Ludlow</name></author><id>tag:www.jedludlow.com,2011-01-22:/2011/01/this-is-perhaps-simplest-slickest-way.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is perhaps the simplest, slickest way to wrap C++ in a C interface

&lt;p&gt;First the header file:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#ifndef INTERFACE_H&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#define INTERFACE_H&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;typedef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Manager&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Manager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;Manager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;create_manager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;destroy_manager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Manager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;manager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;print_manager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Manager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;manager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#ifdef __cplusplus&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#endif&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#endif&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And now the implementation:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cpf"&gt;&amp;quot;interface.h&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    <p>It was a dark day around our house several months ago when it was
announced that no new <a href="http://www.cartalk.com/">Car Talk</a> episodes would be recorded. The show
has been part of my week for nearly 20 years. Like all great shows that
are eventually put out to pasture, we can still enjoy reruns. Much to my
surprise, <a href="http://www.cartalk.com/content/1309-pit-despair">this week's "best-of" show</a> contained <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_IxcYvuiw0WVTlxWGZmZFo4cUE/edit?usp=sharing">my 15 seconds of Car
Talk fame</a>.  </p>
<p>Shortly after starting graduate school, I was dutifully toiling away
on homework one Saturday morning with Car Talk playing in the
background. This was long before the podcast era, so if you didn't hear
it when it was originally broadcast you pretty much missed it for that
week. At any rate, a <a href="http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/CubScouts.aspx">Cub Scout</a> Den Mother called in with some
questions about how to advise her Cubs on the issue of weight placement
in their Pinewood Derby cars. I wasn't completely satisfied with Tom and
Ray's answer, so I wrote up a quick technical note called <em><a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_IxcYvuiw0WTjdBbEJxV291UXM/edit?usp=sharing">On the
Placement of Weight in a Pinewood Derby Car</a> </em>and mailed it in, never
expecting to hear more of it.  </p>
<p>Some weeks later I got a phone call from a relative, asking me if I had
ever sent anything in to the Car Talk guys. I confirmed that I had but
was puzzled as to why he would know about it. It turns out that my
write-up had been mentioned during a "Stump the Chumps" segment of the
show that week, and he called to tell me about it. I had missed the
broadcast entirely. This week's rebroadcast was actually the first time
I heard it for myself.</p>
<p><img style="float:right" src="http://www.jedludlow.com/images/A_Fast_Car.jpg" /></p>
<p>I still have my first Pinewood Derby car, the one that took first place
in my local race. It stays safely packed away in a box and only comes
out for special occasions. You can guess its age by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontiac_Firebird">Firebird</a>
logo on the front. Thanks to a great father and to other great Scout
leaders those were special days never to be forgotten.</p>
<p>Many years later now, it takes more than one hand's worth of fingers to
count the number of derbies I've participated in with my own sons. I can
say with fairly high confidence that, backed by empirical evidence,
weight placement is <em>not</em> the most important factor in the speed of a
car. Sure, you should still bring the car up to the maximum allowable
weight and place that weight near the rear axle to be a competitor. But
invariably the fastest cars have ultra low rolling resistance, and they
<em>track perfectly straight</em>. No amount of weight fiddling can compensate
for a car that incurs huge amounts of drag by continually rubbing up
against the central track guide.</p>

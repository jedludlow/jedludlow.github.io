    <p>What began as a simple exercise in turning on the irrigation water to
the yard culminated in an hour of <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/03/dont_shave_that.html">yak shaving</a> in which I actually
measured the performance of my sprinklers. The well-meaning people at my
City Hall had sent out an informative flyer earlier in the week with
tips about conserving water during the upcoming summer, not recognizing
the Siren song they would ultimately create for me by suggesting that
one could <em>measure</em> and <em>optimize</em> a sprinkler system. While my
engineering disease puts me at risk for over optimization to start with,
I'm particularly susceptible to the temptation posed by measurement
science problems.</p>
<p>The flyer included a link to a web address with detailed
instructions for <a href="http://wateringschedule.com/">computing station timing</a> for a yard irrigation
system, sponsored by <a href="http://www.orbitonline.com/">Orbit Irrigation</a>. I wasn't about to pay for
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CBZB8U8">the catch cup kit</a> they were offering, but fortunately they gave away
the key specification for supplanting the commercial catch cups with
something ad hoc. Off I went looking for something with a 16.25 square
inch catch opening. An opening diameter of about 4.6 inch does the
trick.</p>
<p>With some luck, it didn't take me long to find a reasonable
solution. Who knew that the cottage cheese industry was secretly out to
ruin the catch cup business for the irrigation industry? I no longer
question why my wife has saved so many of these in a drawer in the
kitchen. I now understand that they are a valuable instrument to an
irrigation system measurement technician, and she <em>must</em> have realized
that long before I did.</p>

<p>With catch cups in hand, I headed to the yard to make
measurements. My yard has conventional pop up spray heads in the front
and a bit fancier gear driven rotor heads in the back. When I installed
the rotors a couple of years ago the hardware store people told me I'd
have to run them a lot longer than the old pop ups, but their even spray
pattern would provide better overall performance. Quite honestly, the
back lawn didn't fare very well over the last summer compared to the
front, so a primary goal of my measurements was to get a feel for just
how much longer the recommended station timing would be for the back
yard rotors.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jedludlow.com/images/cups_on_grass.jpg" /></p>
<p>After laying out catch cups and throwing on the stations for
several minutes I was ready to measure the volume of water in each cup.
I debated using a tablespoon and converting the measurements to mL
later, but then I remembered that there is another stash of special
little plastic cups in our house has that has mL graduations built right
in. Thank you, children's cold medicine people, for providing miniature
graduated cylinders in every box!</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jedludlow.com/images/take_your_medicine.jpg" width="300"/></p>
<p>I decided to scale back the effort and only measure one station in the
front and one in the back. I found the simple instructions for mapping
and recording the measurements as suggested by the website to be quite
helpful.  </p>
<p><img src="http://www.jedludlow.com/images/raw_sprinkler_notes.jpg" /></p>
<p>With final measurements in hand it was a simple matter to run the
calculator on the website. I won't post the final recommended run times
since they would be specific to my system, climate, and soil type. But I
will say that, much to my surprise, the gear rotors need to run <em>four
times</em> as long as the pop ups to deliver an equivalent volume of water
to the yard. That's a lot longer than I was running them last summer
when the back grass was looking so bad. And it only took me one
inexpensive yak shave to figure that out.</p>

    <p>A little over a hundred years ago, some bright people 
thought it might be <em>really useful</em> for someone
in New York to talk to someone in San Fransisco <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_transcontinental_telephone_call"><em>by telephone</em></a>.
They eventually succeeded in completing the first
voice test of the system in 1914, and the first "official" 
transcontinental long distance phone call occurred in January
of 1915. 
As is often the case, the first implementation of the system
was really a prototype that would only handle limited load.
The ultimate vision was a system that could handle thousands
of voice calls simultaneously. There were large technical hurdles
to clear to make that a reality.</p>
<p>One of the primary hurdles was amplification. If you want to 
string a very long wire and put lots of phone calls down that same 
wire, you have to place repeater amplifiers 
at points along the line that can boost the 
signal up without distorting it or adding noise to it.
The amplifier technology of 1920 was not up to the task.</p>
<p>In 1921 a young electrical engineer named Harold Black joined the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Electric">Western Electric Company</a>, an arm of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_System">Bell System</a>, eventually
to become part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs">Bell Labs</a> when it was formed in 1925. 
Within several months of joining, 
Harold had succeeded in arranging an assignment to work
on stabilizing and linearizing amplifiers to support the
development of a large-scale long distance phone system. It would
be several years before his work bore fruit.</p>

<em>Harold Black. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Harold_Stephen_Black.gif">(Source)</a></em></p>
<p>If you've studied dynamic systems or control engineering
the names of Nyquist and Bode, also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs">Bell Labs</a> scientists in the
early 20th century,
are most certainly familiar. But Harold Black? You've probably never heard
of him. Yet his invention revolutionized the telecommunications industry and
had far-reaching consequences in other branches of engineering. 
Its impact can hardly be overstated. </p>
<p>What Harold invented is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_feedback_amplifier"><em>negative feedback amplifier</em></a>.
This classic video footage on the subject from the AT&amp;T archives is worth watching:</p>
<div class="youtube" align="left">

</div>

<p>Aside: The hand sketches on newsprint shown in the video actually came five days
later and relate to impedance matching the amplifier to the load.
According to an <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MSPEC.1977.6501721">article published in IEEE Spectrum</a>, the
sketches from the initial invention, also sketched on newsprint, were actually a simple block diagram and a couple of equations.</p>

<em>Negative feedback block diagram and equations. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MSPEC.1977.6501721">(Source)</a></em></p>
<p>For me personally, the invention itself is only part of the significance of this story. I'm
forever grateful for Harold's candor in describing his years
of unsuccessful design attempts and the flash of inspiration that ultimately
accompanied the final breakthrough.
This is <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MSPEC.1977.6501721">his own written description</a> of the event:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then came the morning of Tuesday, August 2, 1927,
when the concept of the negative feedback amplifier came
to me in a flash while I was crossing the Hudson River on
the Lackawanna Ferry, on my way to work. For more than
50 years I have pondered how and why the idea came, and
I can't say any more today than I could that morning. All
I know is that after several years of hard work on the
problem, I suddenly realized that if I fed the amplifier
output back to the input, in reverse phase, and kept the
device from oscillating (singing, as we called it then), I
would have exactly what I wanted: a means of canceling
out the distortion in the output. I opened my morning
newspaper and on a page of <em>The New York Times</em> I
sketched a simple canonical diagram of a negative feedback
amplifier plus the equations for the amplification
with feedback. I signed the sketch, and 20 minutes
later, when I reached the laboratory at 463 West Street,
it was witnessed, understood, and signed by the late Earl
C. Blessing. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>With that, here is my
personal recipe for changing the world while remaining
in relative obscurity, modeled on the work of Harold Black:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pursue opportunities that have the potential of
making a serious difference in the world. Work on hard problems. When solutions
don't immediately present themselves, keep going. Wait
patiently for pure inspiration.</p>
</blockquote>

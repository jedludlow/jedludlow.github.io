<p><em>The words or the language, as they are written or spoken, do not seem
to play any role in my mechanism of thought. The psychical entities
which seem to serve as elements in thought are certain signs and more
or less clear images which can be 'voluntarily' reproduced and
combined. .... This combinatory play seems to be the essential feature
in productive thought before there is any connection with logical
construction in words or other kinds of signs which can be
communicated to others.</em> (Albert Einstein in a letter to Jacques
Hadamard)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://micrium.com/about/management/">Jean Labrosse</a>, the well-respected author of the <a href="http://micrium.com/page/products/rtos/os-ii">µC/OS-II RTOS</a>,
recently published an article in Embedded Systems Design entitled
<a href="http://www.embedded.com/design/prototyping-and-development/4215492/Adopting-C-programming-conventions">Adopting C programming conventions</a>. If you've read the article, you
can easily understand the stir it might create. Some of the ideas he
advocates are not generally accepted as "good practice" among most
embedded developers. It is no surprise that the comment section that
follows the article is full of gripes and is largely devoid of praise.  </p>
<p>Ironically, the source code for µC/OS-II is cited by many as a prime
example of beautiful, clean embedded C code, worthy of study. The RTOS
itself is considered to be highly reliable. True to form, the coding
style throughout conforms to Mr. Labrosse's conventions. Quite a
paradox.  </p>
<p>My first response was to conclude that maybe Mr. Labrosse is just
smarter than all the rest of us, and it wouldn't matter if his coding
style were in complete opposition to what most consider "good practice."
He'd figure out how to bring order to the system and ship something
exceptional. That may, in fact, be true. But then I remembered the above
from Einstein, and it completely changed my line of thought toward
something more productive.   </p>
<p>Source code is such a crude description of the intricate mental models
that reside in our heads when crafting software systems. The process of
first distilling a mental model to code is so much smoother than the
process of recreating a mental model from reading source code.
Unfortunately, most of us lead lives that prevent us from maintaining
that system model in our heads indefinitely. We're constantly required
to rebuild the model after being away from the problem for a while. As I
look closer at Mr. Labrosse's conventions, I see a set of rules that
allow him to create a richer <em>reading</em> experience for himself, each
construct seeded with clues about how it fits into the larger system,
assisting him to reconstruct the "clear images" in his mind each time he
returns to the code. That sounds like "good practice" to me.</p>
